# RL-Zoo

Welcome to the RL-Algorithms-Zoo! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, reimplemented from scratch. Each algorithm is organized into its own folder, with implementations and relevant documentation to facilitate understanding and experimentation.

## Objective

The goal is to implement all major deep RL algorithms from foundational approaches to cutting-edge techniques, allowing for a broad exploration of RL methods.

## Algorithms

The following table lists all the algorithms planned for implementation. The status column indicates whether the algorithm has been implemented or is yet to be completed.
